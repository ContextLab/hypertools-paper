# hypertools-paper

This repository contains final versions of, and all associated materials for, the published versions of the Hypertools paper (arXiv preprint, and JMLR publication) in two respective directories.

Each directory contains: a PDF of the final submitted manuscript, the .tex file, and the associated figures in a 'figs' subdirectory. Any existing "boneyard" subdirectories have content that is either outdated or not directly used in the compilation of the final manuscript(s).
